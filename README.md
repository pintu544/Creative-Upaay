Objective:
Implement a dashboard UI based on the provided Figma file. The goal is to replicate the design as closely as possible and include specific functionalities.
Tools & Technologies:
Â· Framework: ReactJs
UI Libraries: You may use any of the following:
Material-UI
Chakra UI
Tailwind CSS
State Management: Redux
Storage: Local Storage for state persistence
Assignment Requirements:

1. UI Implementation
   Dashboard Layout:
   Replicate the Figma file provided. The UI should match the design as closely as possible.
   The dashboard will contain three stages/sections, each representing a different status of tasks (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").

2. Task Management
   Add Task:
   Implement a feature to add tasks in each section.
   Tasks should have dynamic name and description.
   Other details can be hardcoded for simplicity.
   Move Tasks:
   Implement the functionality to move tasks from one section to another (e.g., dragging a task from "To Do" to "In Progress").
3. Filtering
   Task Filtering:
   Implement a filtering feature that allows users to filter tasks based on certain criteria.
   You can choose the criteria (e.g., task category, due date, priority).
4. State Management
   Redux:
   Use Redux to manage the state of the application.
   Ensure the application state is persistent using Local Storage. This means that tasks and their states should remain intact even after a page refresh.
5. Bonus: Drag and Drop {Not Mandatory}
   Drag and Drop:
   Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between sections.
   This feature is optional but will be considered a strong addition to your implementation.
   Submission Guidelines:
   Repository: Create a public GitHub repository and upload your code there.
   README: Include a README file that explains your approach, any assumptions you made, and how to run the project locally.
   Video Demonstration: Attach a video demonstrating the functionality.
   Evaluation Criteria:
   UI Accuracy: How closely the implementation matches the Figma design.
   Functionality: Proper implementation of the task addition, task movement, filtering, and state management.
   Code Quality: Clean, maintainable code with proper comments and structure.
   State Management: Correct usage of Redux and persistence with Local Storage.
   Bonus: Implementation of drag-and-drop functionality.
