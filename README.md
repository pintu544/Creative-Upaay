Objective:<br>
Implement a dashboard UI based on the provided Figma file. The goal is to replicate the design as closely as possible and include specific functionalities.<br>
Tools &amp; Technologies:<br>
· Framework: ReactJs<br>
UI Libraries: You may use any of the following:<br>
Material-UI<br>
Chakra UI<br>
Tailwind CSS<br>
State Management: Redux<br>
Storage: Local Storage for state persistence<br>
Assignment Requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>UI Implementation<br>
Dashboard Layout:<br>
Replicate the Figma file provided. The UI should match the design as closely as possible.<br>
The dashboard will contain three stages/sections, each representing a different status of tasks (e.g., “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done”).<br>

<li>Task Management<br>
Add Task:<br>
Implement a feature to add tasks in each section.<br>
Tasks should have dynamic name and description.<br>
Other details can be hardcoded for simplicity.<br>
Move Tasks:<br>
Implement the functionality to move tasks from one section to another (e.g., dragging a task from “To Do” to “In Progress”).</li>
<li>Filtering<br>
Task Filtering:<br>
Implement a filtering feature that allows users to filter tasks based on certain criteria.<br>
You can choose the criteria (e.g., task category, due date, priority).</li>
<li>State Management<br>
Redux:<br>
Use Redux to manage the state of the application.<br>
Ensure the application state is persistent using Local Storage. This means that tasks and their states should remain intact even after a page refresh.</li>
<li>Bonus: Drag and Drop {Not Mandatory}<br>
Drag and Drop:<br>
Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between sections.<br>
This feature is optional but will be considered a strong addition to your implementation.<br>
Submission Guidelines:<br>
Repository: Create a public GitHub repository and upload your code there.<br>
README: Include a README file that explains your approach, any assumptions you made, and how to run the project locally.<br>
Video Demonstration: Attach a video demonstrating the functionality.<br>
Evaluation Criteria:<br>
UI Accuracy: How closely the implementation matches the Figma design.<br>
Functionality: Proper implementation of the task addition, task movement, filtering, and state management.<br>
Code Quality: Clean, maintainable code with proper comments and structure.<br>
State Management: Correct usage of Redux and persistence with Local Storage.<br>
Bonus: Implementation of drag-and-drop functionality.</li>
